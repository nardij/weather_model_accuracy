Overview:

This project explores the accuracy of two different whether models in terms of predicting daily maximum temperatures, daily minimum temperatures, and probabilities of precipitation. One of the two models examined, the Global Forecasting System (GFS), predicts the weather based solely on a predictive algorithm. The other model, which comes from the National Weather Service (NWS), is a primarily human prediction model that draws on data from a number of algorithms, including the GFS. In a field where improving model accuracy is the goal, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach is paramount.
